# DNA Sequence Analyzer ðŸ§¬

This is a simple Python mini-project for analyzing real DNA sequence data (FASTA format). It was created as a portfolio project for learning bioinformatics coding.

## What It Does

- Reads a FASTA file
- Calculates GC content
- Plots base composition using matplotlib

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib

## How to Run

1. Download a sample FASTA file (e.g. from NCBI)
2. Put the file in the same folder as `analyze_dna.py`
3. Run the script:

```bash
markdown
